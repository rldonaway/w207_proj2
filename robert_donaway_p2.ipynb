    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "*4. Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it is because the vectors are so long and sparse. Documents with the same label could be far from each other if they just share a few representative terms in common, and a document with a different label could be closer because it shares more general terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?*\n",
    "\n",
    "My guess is that it is because Logistic Regression is still a linear model that has to compute a coefficient for each term. Small non-zero coefficients for several terms will add up and cause the output probability to be higher. Also, having two occurrences of a term will add the coefficent twice. There may not be a linear relationship like this in the training data. Naive Bayes multiplies the observed probabilities of each term with the probability of each term given each of the classes. No linear relationship is assumed.\n",

    "*6. What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller the C value (inverse of lambda), the greater the penalty for a large weight, so as C gets smaller, so does the magnitude of the weights."

Also, some of the top 5 bigrams don't seem to have much content, such as \"you are\", \"was just\", \"and such\", and \"does anyone\". Maybe this is due to too small a sample size. Also, some of the coefficients in the top 5 are negative, meaning having that bigram would greatly reduce the probability of being from that particular category."

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the transformed training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

    "*How is `TfidfVectorizer` different than `CountVectorizer`?*\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: For each document, `CountVectorizer` produces a vector where each entry corresponds to a term and is a count of how many times that term appears in the document. This is the term frequency (tf). If the words \"and\" and \"vehicle\" each appear three times, they will be counted equally. However, the word \"and\" will appear in almost every other document, while the word \"vehicle\" will only appear in certain documents. `TfidfVectorizer` tries to account for the ability of words to distinguish documents by essentially dividing the term frequency by the number of times the word appears in the entire collection of documents. This is the document frequency (df) and the tf is being divided by the df, so it is the inverse document frequency (idf). Therefore, in the example, the count for \"and\" would be divided by a very large number, making its contribution to the vector small. The count for \"vehicle\" would be divided by a much smaller number since that term appears less often in the collection of documents, making its contribution to the vector larger than the contribution of \"and\", despite the fact that each term appeared three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explain what the R ratio describes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: It tells you how bad the prediction is. The lowest (and best) R can be is 1, meaning the probabilities of the prediction and the actual values are the same. But when R is much larger than 1, it indicates the model was quite certain that the correct category was incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kinds of mistakes is the model making?* \n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: I think it is picking up vocabulary that is very significant in the predicted topic but that is only represents a secondary focus of the article. For example, ftp, LaTeX and postscript could easily be used in an article about computer graphics but they are actually being used when describing a text on religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suggest a way to address one particular issue that you see.*\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: Somehow, we have to increase the effect of words that are very representative of the category over words in another category. For example, seeing \"Mormon\" should greatly increase the probability of one of the religion categories over the computer graphics category. Above, I looked at the tf-idf values for 'mormon' and 'ftp' in document 665 and found that 'mormon' does have a higher value. But when looking at the coefficients on 'mormon' and 'ftp' in the model, 'ftp' has a much higher value for its natural category than 'mormon' does for its category. Also, for 'mormon' the other categories have negative values that are small in magnitude while 'ftp' has greater magnitude negative values for its other categories. This gives 'ftp' a much greater pull towards the computer graphics category.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder if using a Naive Bayes model would do better with this. Also, could the problem be with \"Mormon\", \"Mormon's\" and \"Mormon\"\" being counted as different words, thereby weakening their influence? I would try the document preprocessing from above to try to collapse them into the same word. Similarly, performing stemming to include 'mormonism' and 'mormons' with 'mormon' could increase its influence. Also, maybe we need to allow higher weights on the coefficients, so using a larger C value might help."

    "I checked the Naive Bayes model and it did improve f1, but it still could not correctly classify the problematic documents shown above. Similarly, using a C value of 300 improved f1, but the documents with a high R-ratio were still incorrectly classified and the ratios actually went up. Stemming did not improve the f1 value, but one of the worst R-ratio documents was different. I tried getting rid of terms with a high document frequency but this didn't help and gave the same three worst documents. "
